-   Card Game to understand more about go language.
-   GO is a static typed langugae with the type declared.
-   data types:
    -   bool
    -   string
    -   int
    -   float64
-   `name := "Aditya"` := is used to declare the variable when initializing the variable
-   return type of the function is mentioned after the function declaration.

    -   e.g func functionName() int { return `integer`}
    -   Every function that returns a value must indicate what type of value it is returning.
    -   Files in the same package do not have to be imported into each other.
    -   Files in the same package can freely call functions defined in other files.

-   `slice` is similar to array but array has fixed size slice is flexible
    -   slice can have only one type of value
